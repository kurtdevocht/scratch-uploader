Scratch Uploader
================

Can be used to automate uploading your Scratch 2.0 projects to the Scratch website http://scratch.mit.edu.

1. Select the folder that contains your Scratch projects (.sb2)

>C:\MyAwesomeProjects\Thinghy1.sb2

>C:\MyAwesomeProjects\Thinghy2.sb2

>C:\MyAwesomeProjects\X-Mas Special\Jingle.sb2

>C:\MyAwesomeProjects\X-Mas Special\Bells.sb2

2. Select a prefix, and all files will be copied to an intermediate subdirectory '__out'. If '__out' already exists, this directory should be deleted first.

>C:\MyAwesomeProjects\Thinghy1.sb2 => C:\MyAwesomeProjects\\__out\prefix - Thinghy1.sb2

>C:\MyAwesomeProjects\Thinghy2.sb2 => C:\MyAwesomeProjects\\__out\prefix - Thinghy2.sb2

>C:\MyAwesomeProjects\X-Mas Special\Jingle.sb2 => C:\MyAwesomeProjects\\__out\prefix - X-Mas Special - Jingle.sb2

>C:\MyAwesomeProjects\X-Mas Special\Bells.sb2 => C:\MyAwesomeProjects\\__out\prefix - X-Mas Special - Bells.sb2
	
3. Enter your Scratch user name and password. All projects from the '__out' directory will be opened and uploaded. While uploading, the application will take a screenshot, so don't do anything else on your pc.
